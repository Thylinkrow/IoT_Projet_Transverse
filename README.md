## Description

### Security and Integrity
The messages are identified and checked
* Destination
* Source
* Network ID
* Type of device concerned (Gateway, Aggregator or Sensor)

**Packet header**

The messages are encrypted (using [tiny AES](https://github.com/kokke/tiny-AES-c) by [kokke](https://github.com/kokke)).
The integrity of each messages is checked using a CRC

### Sending messages spread on multiple packets
The 64 bytes limit has then been increased to 512 bytes.
Each packet is identified within a message.
When a packet is missing the recieving device can ask 3 times the sender to resend the missing packets.
